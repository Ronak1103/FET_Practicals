    <h2>HTML</h2>
    <p class="content">The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets and scripting languages such as JavaScript.</p>
    
    <h2>CSS</h2>
    <p class="content">Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.</p>
    
    <h2>JavaScript</h2>
    <p class="content">JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries.</p>
    
    <h2>DOM</h2>
    <p class="content">The Document Object Model is a cross-platform and language-independent interface that treats an XML or HTML document as a tree structure wherein each node is an object representing a part of the document. The DOM represents a document with a logical tree.</p>
    
    <h2>DHTML</h2>
    <p class="content">Dynamic HTML, or DHTML, is a term which was used by some browser vendors to describe the combination of HTML, style sheets and client-side scripts that enabled the creation of interactive and animated documents. The application of DHTML was introduced by Microsoft with the release of Internet Explorer 4 in 1997.</p>
    
    <script>
        
        var headings = document.getElementsByTagName("h2");
        
        for (var i = 0; i < headings.length; i++) {
            var heading = headings[i];
            heading.addEventListener("click", function() {

                var contents = document.getElementsByClassName("content");
                for (var j = 0; j < contents.length; j++) {
                    contents[j].style.display = "none";
                }
                this.nextElementSibling.style.display = "block";
            });
